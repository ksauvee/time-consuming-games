            <p class="member-presentation">Within the framework of the realization of our website,
                I contributed to the implementation of the home page and the installation of our form of suggestions of games,
                as well as the creation of the dynamic table.
                Moreover, I realized 3 games which are, Speed Typing, Single Pong and Find The Country.
                Finally, I implemented the page you are currently on.</p>
