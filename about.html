            <p class="member-presentation">Within the framework of the realization of our website,
                I contributed to the implementation of the home page and the installation of our form of suggestions of games,
                as well as the creation of the dynamic table.
                Moreover, I realized 3 games which are, Speed Typing, Single Pong and Find The Country.
                Finally, I implemented the page you are currently on.</p>

            <p class="member-presentation">During the creation of the website I was able to create 2 games : <br>
                - find the word <br>
                - find the button <br>
                I also helped Kylian develop the main menu, and the suggestion form. 
                I was also able to correct the responsive nature of the site and 
                was able to correct some bugs, especially on games.</p>
